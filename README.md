Rael Time Weather Update

This Python project fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city using web scraping techniques. The data is retrieved from Google search results and parsed with BeautifulSoup.
Features

    Real-time Weather Updates: Get the current weather condition, temperature, location, and time.
    Randomized User-Agent: Uses a randomized User-Agent header to help prevent detection as a bot.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
    Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip.

Installation

    Clone or Download: Download this project or clone the repository using:

Error Handling

    The script includes error handling to manage cases where the weather information could not be retrieved. If the weather data is not available, you will see:

    Weather information could not be retrieved. Please try again later.

Notes

    Accuracy: The script relies on Google search results, so the accuracy and availability of weather data may vary.
    Limitations: This script may not work if Google changes the structure of its search results or if it blocks automated requests. For more reliable access to weather data, consider using a dedicated weather API.

Future Improvements

    Implement a more robust solution using a weather API like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.
    Add support for more languages and temperature units (e.g., Fahrenheit).
    Optimize the script to handle a broader range of errors and unexpected webpage changes.
